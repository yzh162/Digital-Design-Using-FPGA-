### Pro1: HappyBirthday Song with LED state cycle
### Pro2: Calculator with LCD 
          1. Calculator with unsigned “add” , “multiply” , and “<” and “>” functions. 
            (The latter are the “less than” and “greater than” operations which yield two possible results : “TRUE” or “FALSE”)
          2. To receive the numbers and operations, the project uses the PS2 keyboard to input
          3. Use ENTER, ESC to get result and exit calculation
          4. The calculator uses the LCD display to display the results as well as the Hyperterminal
### Proj3: Ping Pang Game: 
          1. The ball will keep moving clockwise without interruption
          2. RTS button to reset score to 0
          3. When the user moves the mouse up and down, the racket moves up and down
          4. The racket will move up and down on the right side and will “hit” the ball when the ball is in that position, if 
            the user misses the ball, (s)he has to wait until the next round.
